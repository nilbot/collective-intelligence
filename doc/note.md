# average opinions trumps trusted group

* The wisdom of crowds
aggregating the opinions

## categorization of collective intelligence

sort of quadrant diagram
and collective intelligence is a combination of artificial intelligence 
(machine mimicking human) and data driven intelligence (machine
learning patterns from data)


## pieces of the game
### computation
more computing power, more access and availablilty

### rise of the social web
collectively, individual contribution.. are valuable.

* some problems are suited for machines, while others require human intelligence

# a new computational paradigm
it's not trivial to get people to contribute to your collective scheme.

> game play is often a good incentive to get people to contribute.

## new developments

* big data IoT // sensor // privacy challenge
* blockchain revolution
* reputation and attention economies (online -> offline?)
* gamification

# the output / goal / question to ask

important first step for all data science, what is the question you want to ask

# aggregation methods

mathematic aggregation
$$\pi\cdot r^2\cdot h$$ for guessing jellybeans jar


# predictive diversity

$$ PDiv(\vec{s}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(s_i-c)^2 $$

and the thoerem says

$$ SqE(c) = SqE(\vec{s}) - PDiv(\vec{s}) $$

$SqE(c)$ crowd error will be small if we have big $SqE(\vec{s})$ and big
diversity
